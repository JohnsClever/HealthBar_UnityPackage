	*------How to use?------*
	1. Look inside Resources/Prefabs/HealthBarPrefabs 
	That is what you need. After that, put it into the
	child of any gameobject(meant to be monster or player)
	Scale it down to matches your screen or level.

	2. In HpManagerScript(inside the prefabs)
	Assign both your main Camera, Max Hp, and Hp
	*Hp is current healthpoint. You can adjust the colorRamp
	of your health bar when it reaches specific value. 

	3. Also, tweak your name and monster level in
	NamingAndLevelScript. That is all for now.
